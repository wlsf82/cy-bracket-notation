# cy-bracket-notation

![Cypress tests](https://github.com/wlsf82/cy-bracket-notation/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Sample project to demonstrate how to call Cypress and custom commands using the [JS bracket notion](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_Accessors#bracket_notation), instead of the [dot notation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_Accessors#dot_notation).
